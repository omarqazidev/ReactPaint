# ReactPaint - A React Page Builder.

## Objective:
The primary objective of ReactPaint is to provide developers with a user-interface-based tool that will allow them to easily design webpages, and generate ReactJS and relating code (HTML, CSS).

## Goals:
**Reduce Workload:** Developers can focus on their product’s design rather than on writing redundant code.<br>
**Clean Code:** The goal is not only to generate working code, but also to generate code that is easily readable and understandable.<br>
**Integrate-able:** I was working towards providing a tool that generates code which is easily integrable with other codebases.<br>

## Stakeholders:
I wanted to develop a tool that will assist technical users in designing web applications. Time is of paramount importance. Each hour spent in coding and debugging could be more profitable, if spent on designing and problem solving.

## Technologies:
- It is written primarily in React with TypeScript.
- Redux with Immer is used for state management.
- ReactDnD is used to handle drag-and-drop features.
- Semantic UI, BootStrap and custom CSS components are used for styling.
